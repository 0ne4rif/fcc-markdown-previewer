# Getting Started with Markdown Previewer

This is my solution for Freecodecamp's Markdown Previewer challenge.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Modify initial text

You may modify the initial text at src/text.js.
